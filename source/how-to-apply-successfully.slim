	#NUMA: How to Apply Successfully

	So you think you have a great project and you want to be accelerated at NUMA, here is a complete guide on how to apply successfully:

	##Who Can Apply?

	###All fields accepted
	NUMA is an horizontal accelerator, we work with startups from all fields: whether it be hi-tech B2B SaaS solutions (Deepomatic, Realytics), marketplaces for travel and tourism (Skippair, Darjeelin), hardware for entertainment and connected objects  (Qleek, Fliike, FretX ), C2C marketplaces (Showroomer, TripnDrive) we can handle it across the board.

	###All stages accepted
	Yes, we're open to projects at all stages: from idea to worldwide market expansion. 
	This doesn't mean it's all the same to us, we know the risks involved in investing our resources at earlier stages, so the earlier your stage, the brighter your team will need to shine.
	A stellar team that has already launched and sold a successful product before could have better chances at the idea stage than a team at the prototype stage that's working for the first time together. 

	###No solo founders, CTO required
	Finding the right cofounder can take a while and we don't want you to spend the short time you have with us doing recruitment or trying to find a partner: our job is to accelerate your business and we cannot do it unless the basic components are in place. 
	We've seen too many well-meaning entrepreneurs with great potential completely stuck with their project simply because no one could execute on decisions or burned out from carrying too much responsibility on their own.
	If you're solo, take this as your first challenge: persuade someone that you're an excellent business partner and that your project has great potential. If you can't do that, how will you persuade your customers?

	###On-site attendance
	We advise that all founders and team members essential to the operation of the business are present at NUMA Paris during the extent of the program from mid-February 2016 to end of July 2016. Community is the secret sauce of our program and a fundamental ingredient of the acceleration. 

	##Dates
	Application period
	6th Nov 2015 - 6th Dec 2015
	You have one month to fill in the application form on F6S, we don't start the evaluation process until applications are closed.

	###First selection phase
	7th Dec 2015 - 30 Dec 2015
	During this phase each completed application is evaluated independently by at least three experts covering different fields: business, technology and product. At the end of this phase we usually select around 50 startups for the semi-finals. This year we expect around 8% of applicants to pass this phase. 

	###Semi-finals
	5th-9th January 2016
	During the semi-finals you'll be invited to pitch in front of a jury of experts that will ask challenging questions about your project and your team.
	You'll have 5 minutes to pitch and 10 minutes for the Q&A. 
	We prefer to meet you in person at NUMA Paris, we can arrange a video-conference meeting, but keep in mind that connection problems and audio quality can end up impacting the presentation.
	Startups usually get their results within three days.

	###Finals
	18th-19th January 2016
	During the finals the jury will dig a bit deeper, you'll have 10 minutes to talk about your startup and 15 minutes for the Q&A.
	We usually select between 12 and 22 startups in this last phase, the results are delivered within <insert number of days>

	###Formal agreement
	Deadline: 21st Jan 2016
	If you've made it through the finals, along with our sincere congratulations you'll receive an agreement detailing the program's conditions (<insert link here>) and a bunch of legal documents regarding our future partnership. We'll need your signature before we can confirm your participation in the program.

	###Visa application
	21st Jan 2016 - 7th Feb 2016 
	If anyone on your team requires a visa for their 4-month stay in Paris you should start your visa application procedures as soon as your participation is confirmed. Don't hesitate to bring this up with the staff if you have questions or need help. If you're a foreign startup read <insert Foreign Startups guide> link.

	###Kick-off
	15th Feb 2016
	We pop the Champagne to celebrate the start of the new acceleration season and we welcome the startups onboard.

	##Using F6S
	F6S can be tricky to use, but remember this:
	- Your form is automatically saved, don't worry (don't believe it? look at the top left corner of the page after you make a change), you can always come back and finish it later
	- If you get lost hot the home link then go to Groups > Numa Season 8 (it's in the left sidebar)
	- It's almost guaranteed that you'll miss something the first time you Submit the application, F6S tells you what information is missing, but if you have trouble finding it remember that there 

	##How to apply to a startup accelerator successfully

	Here you'll learn how to hit the spot with your accelerator application:  the dos and don'ts, the frequent mistakes and tips on how to answer the trickiest questions.

	Once you read this not only you'll improve your odds of getting into NUMA, chances are you'll also have a better shot at any other startup accelerator.

	##Take your time
	The first rule is: don't rush it. If it's your first time, the application questionnaire will require some serious thinking and discussion with your team: print out the questions, fire up the coffeemaker and gather your companions around the whiteboard.
	Evaluators can easily tell when an application has been thrown together in a haste by the CEO or copy/pasted from some generic slide deck. 
	This is a collaborative effort, some questions require each founder to answer individually, make sure you set aside some time to work on it, I guarantee it'll be worth it.

	##English
	We only accept applications submitted in English as some of our evaluators do not speak other languages.

	##Team, team, team

	<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdlAs9g2udM>

	Did we say team already? Team!
	The quality of the team is the most important factor in deciding whether we'll be working with you or not, below you'll be able to read 

	##Answering the questionnaire

	####Tell us about your team and why it's a great team for this project.
	Here we're trying to get an idea of your team as a system.  The questions we ask ourselves are: have they already worked together and how well do they know each other? How experienced are they in their respective fields?  Do their skills match the project’s challenges? Are the roles clearly defined and is there a natural leader? 

	####How did you determine the equity distribution among cofounders? 
	Rather than a simple question, this is an exhortation to have the most uncomfortable conversation with your team while you're still in time. It's better to get rid of the elephant in the room now to make sure we're building a business on solid foundations.

	The questions we're really answering here are: Does each member hold an amount of shares proportional to his future role, contribution and responsibilities? How could equity distribution reveal or impact personal involvement in the project?

	Even if your company is not incorporated yet, you'd probably better lay all cards on the table now and be honest about what's expected of each member and what they'll get in return. We've seen bad breakups happen after months of hard work because of misaligned personal assumptions cofounders had about how much value they brought to the project. 

	####Why did you start/join this project? What drives you?
	The why can be more important than the what. While your market and your product can easily change during the lifetime of your business, your motivations rarely do.
	What we try to understand here is what makes you tick, the hidden force underlying your actions.
	Don't make the mistake of thinking that some reasons are better than others: some entrepreneurs do it for the challenge of solving complex problems, some hunger for knowledge, some others out of a sense of social justice, some just out of rebellion or to prove everyone else wrong. All of these are equally good reasons and all can function as the fuel that gets you through the perils of Startupland. Apply some introspection and dig out your own answer, this question needs to be answered individually by each founder. Once you've done that, try this: compare your answer with the ones of your cofounders: can your individual motivations align for a common goal?

	####Tell us something you're proud of: for example an achievement of yours, a clever feat or something that shows your resourcefulness or creativity.
	One of our favourite questions because the answers are often both fun and revealing. We're looking for a sparkle of genius or that thing you did which shows you're not one to give up when faced with a difficult situation.
	An entrepreneur that displays lateral thinking or is relentless in pursuing his/her goals in spite of hardships is someone who strikes us as a great candidate. Try this: have each founders write down a personal answer and see if you spot similarity or complementarity in your approach.

	###Your project
	####Pitch your startup in 140 characters or less.
	If you only had a single tweet to explain to the world what you do, how would it read? Here you'll have to exercise your marketing and communication skills to get across your unique value proposition in a nutshell.  

	####What problem are you solving for your customers?
	Here we look at how well you understand the pain point you're working on alleviating, the depth of your empathy with the customer and your ability to detach yourself from the solution you're building.
	We ask you not to talk about your solution because a common mistake entrepreneurs make is to fall in love with their solution and forget that what matters is delivering value to customers. A customer rarely cares about how you solve their problem as long as you do solve it. A solution can rarely fix more than a single problem, but a single problem can be fixed many different ways, that's why we look for people that are good at analysing problems first.
	Tip: your customer's problem is not the lack of your solution.

	####Describe the difference between someone who is your early adopter and someone who could be a potential customer at a later stage.
	This question is about market segmentation, your customer knowledge and how far you went into researching what makes a client worth pursuing. Among the factors that determine the choice of your primary target customer, the ones we look at here are the margin of improvement your solution brings them, recurrence, your personal affinity or privileged access to the niche of choice and its profitability. Identify the essential difference between early adopters and that wider audience you might acquire only at a later stage.

	####What are your advantages and disadvantages compared to your direct or indirect competitors?
	Here we try to understand several things: quantify the improvement your solution brings to the customer segment compared to competitors, how crowded the market is, what you've learned from researching it, how likely it would be to build a monopoly. The most common mistake startups make is to say they have no competitors because no-one does exactly what they do: remember it's not how you solve the problem, it's the essence of the problem (and possibly the customer segment) that puts you in the same playing field with competitors, if something solves the same problem in a sub-optimal way, it is still an alternative solution. 
	Even when you have no competitors to name you're still competing with your customer's way of currently dealing with his problem and you'll have to think of what will make them overcome the friction of adopting your solution instead. 
	Pretending competitors don't exist is counterproductive because we'll assume that you either haven't done your research, don't understand what a competitor is or that you think we don't know how to use a search engine, it looks bad in all three cases.

	####Do you have any paying customers?
	Don't be scared if you don't, we use this question just to evaluate what stage your startup is at.
	If you do, the good news is that those evaluators that didn't believe the problem you're working on is worth solving are now proven wrong.

	####What’s your current and/or future revenue model?
	If you are to build a sustainable and hopefully profitable business you may have to answer this question sooner or later. We'd like to challenge you to think about this now and show us you're capable of looking at your startup as a self-sustainable system with inputs and outputs, where the value you are capturing is higher than the resources you are expending. 

	####What are some of you current metrics?
	How can you know you're moving in the right direction if you don't have a reference point? Your answer gives us an idea of how mature your business is, but more importantly what indicators you're using to measure progress. Have you heard about the terms vanity metrics? If you haven't, google it.

	####Will you attend the program on-site and full time?
	One of NUMA's main differentiator is the great community, we strongly encourage the core team of your startup to be present at NUMA the whole time of the program, no matter how well your remote coordination skills are, you'd be missing on an essential component of the value proposition.
	With this said, we've worked with distributed teams before, but these are more the exception than the rule. 

	Wow, you read this whole guide! As a reward, let us give you a final, semi-secret tip: recommendations.
	At the end of the questionnaire you'll find a recommendations box, the best type of recommendation you can get is from an alumni of our acceleration program. If you don't know anyone from our previous cohorts, it's a good opportunity to find out more about the program from people who went through it and at the same time get recommended, you can find the [list of alumni](http://www.numa.paris/Startups/(season)/6) here (if you can't find them all, try to view it in the French version).

	That's all folks, good luck with your applications!
